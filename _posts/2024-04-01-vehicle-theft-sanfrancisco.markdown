In today's post, we'll look at how vehicle theft incidents in San Francisco have evolved over the years from 2003 to 2018. We used a public dataset that provides us with knowledge about the number of occurrences of various crimes in San Francisco neighborhoods, but we will focus mainly on the one mentioned earlier, as it drew our attention the most. You can access the data [`at this link`](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry/about_data). We invite you to read this post!
