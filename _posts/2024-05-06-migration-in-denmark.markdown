In today's post, we'll take a look at what both immigration to Denmark and emigration from Denmark looked like between 2015 and 2023, taking into account people aged 0-80 and EU/EEA countries. We found it interesting to find out in which countries, Denmark was most often chosen to anchor, and where Danish residents left in favor of another country during this period. Like last time, below we have provided some visualizations that make it easier to catch the curious insights and patterns. We invite you to read this post!

# Dataset Used

We used two public datasets from Statistics Denmark that provide us with knowledge about the number of people who have immigrated to Denmark and emigrated from Denmark. The data present the respective counts of immigrants and emigrants for each year between 2015 and 2023, categorized by gender, age, country of origin/destination, and citizenship. Let us once again remark that we are focusing on people aged 0-80 and countries within the EU/EEA zone. The dataset on immigration can be accessed [`at this link`](https://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?MainTable=INDVAN&PLanguage=1&PXSId=0&wsid=cftree) and the dataset on emigration [`at this link`](https://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?MainTable=UDVAN&PLanguage=1&PXSId=0&wsid=cftree).

# Initial Overview on Migration (2015-2023)

In the visualization above, you can see how immigration and emigration in general looked like over these 9 years. The third graph shows the balance of the ratio of immigration to emigration.

In the case of immigration, you can see that in total the largest number of people arrived in Denmark in 2022 was just under 52,000, while the smallest number arrived in 2020 was just over 38,000. In contrast, the largest number of people in total emigrated from Denmark in 2018, more than 31,000, and the smallest in 2021, a little over 25,000.

In the case of the ratio of immigrants to emigrants, you can see that the ratio of the largest number of immigrants to the smallest number of emigrants took place in 2022 (more than 22,000 migrants "on the plus side"), and the ratio of the smallest number of immigrants to the largest number of emigrants in 2019 (just under 11,000 migrants "on the plus side").

# Top 15 Countries

<img src="/assets/img/top_15_countries.png" alt="PNG" style="width:100%; height:auto;">

The visualization below shows the top 15 countries from which people immigrated to Denmark and the top 15 countries to which people emigrated from Denmark between 2015 and 2023. Interestingly, the countries to which immigration from Denmark is most frequent are also the ones to which emigration from Denmark takes place.

In the case of immigration, the most top six countries from which people arrived in Denmark are Germany, Romania, Poland, Sweden, Norway, and Spain. In the case of emigration, the most top six countries to which people left Denmark are Germany, Sweden, Norway, Poland, Romania, and Spain.

The third bar chart takes into account these 15 countries and sheds light on their immigration-to-emigration ratio, to understand for which countries individuals arriving from there to Denmark after 2015 were more inclined to stay at least until 2023.

Therefore, the top 6 countries from which newcomers arriving in Denmark after 2015 were most willing to stay in the country at least until 2023, compared to those leaving, are Romania, Poland, Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, and Spain.
